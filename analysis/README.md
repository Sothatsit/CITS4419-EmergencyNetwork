# Analysis

This directory contains our experimental dataset and our analysis of it. The data recorded from each node during our experiments are available in `logs-node1`, `logs-node2`, and `logs-node3`. The configurations used for each experiment is also listed in the `configs.json` file. The Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb` contains the code that we used to process this log data and present it in graphical formats. The generated graphs are also available in the `graphs` directory.
