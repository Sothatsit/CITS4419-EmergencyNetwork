# Jupyter Notebook Analysis

## Concepts and Preparation
In this lab you will design and analyse experiments to explore the effect of LoRa parameters. You will build on experience from `week X` lecture and applying the knowledge in a practical environment.

Before the lab you should review the lecture material and papers on LoRa from `week X`.

## Lab Tasks

1. After completing the [Lab Tasks](/MPE-LoRa/Lab_Tasks/README.md), open an instance of `Jupyter Notebook`

2. Navigate to the directory below:
```
C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Documents\Arduino\MPE LoRa\LoRa_ipynb
```
3. Open the `LoRa-Analysis.ipynb` Python Notebook.

4. Edit cell 3 to read the .csv file with your data
```
df = pd.read_csv ('~\Documents\Arduino\MPE LoRa\Log_Files\<YOUR_CSV_FILE>',sep=',')
```
