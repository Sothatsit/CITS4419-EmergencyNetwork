test 1: 0 transmit power
- almost at ezone cafe when it failed
- approximately -115 packet rssi when failed (>50% packet loss)

test 2: -10 transmit power
- at crosswalk it started to fail (>50% packet loss)

test 3: spreading factor = 5 (down from 8)
- Only received a few corrupted packets

test 4: spreading factor = 7
- Just before crosswalk it started to fail
- Chosen as parameter to use

test 5: spreading factor = 6
- Only received corrupted packets

test 6: bandwidth = 125E3 (down from 250E3)
- At crosswalk it started to fail


test 7: -20 transmit power
- Receiving packets fine at crosswalk (-108 Packet RSSI)

test 8: coding rate = 10 (up from 5)
- No difference

test 9: bandwidth = 500E3
- Failed just before crosswalk

test 10: bandwidth = 1000E3
- Worked just fine before crosswalk

test 11: coding rate = 0 (down from 10)
- No difference

test 12: removing receiver antenna
- Reduced Packet RSSI by approximately 20

test 13: removing sender antenna (no receiver antenna as well)
- Received no packets

test 14: transmit power = 0
- About the same range
